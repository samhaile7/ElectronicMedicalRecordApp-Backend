# Electronic Medical Record App


## HIPAA disclosure
ALL patient identifiers used in this app are fictional. 
App is used for technical demonstration purposes only 
and is not to be used as medical or therapeutic data and/or advice. 

Idea for this app inspired by missing functionality of hospital EMR software used while rehabilitating patients in the ICU as an occupational therapist. 

### App Features


- Calculates and displays if a hospital patient taking thrombolytics/blood thinners is safe to mobilize by healthcare professionals based on blood lab values. 

- Allows healthcare providers to have a patient dashboard where they are served vital information about their patient list/caseload at a glance.

- Allows healthcare providers to retrieve, remove, update, delete patient and lab data.

Version 2.0: Will be a Spring Boot MVC application
